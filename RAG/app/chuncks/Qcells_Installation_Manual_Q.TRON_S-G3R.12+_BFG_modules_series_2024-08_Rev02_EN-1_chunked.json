      "content": "**Symbols and Labels – Descriptive Overview**\n\nThe manual for the **Q.TRON S‑G3R.12+ BFG modules series** employs a set of graphical symbols to streamline the presentation of information. Each symbol is associated with a specific type of instruction or warning. The table in the original documentation lists four distinct symbols, each paired with a concise description of its intended meaning. Although the visual representations of the symbols are not reproduced in the text, the accompanying descriptions are reproduced verbatim below.\n\n| Symbol (graphical placeholder) | Meaning / Description |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **[Symbol 1]** | *Procedure with one or more steps.* This symbol signals that the following text outlines a multi‑step process that the user must follow. |\n| **[Symbol 2]** | *Lists of items.* When this symbol appears, the content that follows is organized as a list, typically enumerating components, actions, or specifications. |\n| **[Symbol 3]** | *Ensure that when carrying out a procedure, you check the results of said procedure.* This symbol reminds the reader to verify the outcome after each step of a procedure, emphasizing verification as part of the workflow. |\n| **[Symbol 4]** | *Prohibited.* The presence of this symbol indicates an action or condition that must not be performed or allowed under any circumstances. |\n\n> **Note of Caution:** The documentation also includes a general advisory: *Beware of possible danger or damage.* This statement underscores the importance of observing all symbols and their associated instructions to avoid hazards.\n\n---\n\n### Warning and Information Categories\n\nThe manual classifies safety and informational messages into three distinct categories, each identified by a specific label:\n\n1. **Danger** – Indicates a **risk of fatal injury**. Situations marked with this label present an immediate threat to life and must be avoided or mitigated without delay.\n2. **Attention** – Denotes a **risk of serious injury or damage to property**. These warnings highlight conditions that could cause significant personal harm or substantial damage to equipment or surroundings if not properly addressed.\n3. **Note** – Signifies a **risk of damage to the product** itself. This label alerts the user to actions or conditions that could impair the functionality or integrity of the Q.TRON S‑G3R.12+ BFG modules.\n\nEach of these categories is used consistently throughout the manual to draw the reader’s attention to the severity and nature of the associated risk. By recognizing the symbols and their linked descriptions, as well as the categorical labels (Danger, Attention, Note), users can safely navigate the procedures, lists, verification steps, and prohibitions outlined in the documentation.",

Only substances, which are released by Qcells, are allowed to be used during installation, operation and maintenance.\n- Any installation of modules on surfaces of water is prohibited. This includes installations on floating as well as pile-based platforms. Qcells may extend the coverage of its warranty to such installations, based on a case by case assessment of the system design and location. A prior written consent by the warrantor is required in any case.\n\nThe solar modules are designed for the following applications:\n\n- Operating temperatures from −40 °C to +85 °C (−40 °F to +185 °F).\n- Pull loads up to max. 2,400 Pa and push loads up to max. 5,400 Pa (see chapter \"Mounting options\").\n- Installation using a mounting structure for solar modules.",

The mechanical stability of the mounting system including clamps has to be evaluated by the system supplier.

The installer has to make sure that the used clamps and rails are capable of securely fastening the module under the specified maximum loads.\n- → The system installer is responsible for the determination of location-specific load requirements.\n- → Ensure, that the connection cables of the junction box do not run between laminate and mounting rails.\n- → Modules bend under load. Therefore, sharp objects (e.g. screws, ballast stones, rail ends, rails with burrs or sharp corners) must not be placed near the module backside so as not to touch the laminate under load.\n- → Ensure that the junction boxes do not touch the mounting structure (e.g. shorts rails, ballast, etc.) or the rooftop under load.\n- → Clamps must not touch the glass (even under load).\n- → Unbalanced loads (e.g. snow overhangs, snowdrifts) which result in locally significantly increased loads must be removed or avoided by technical measures.",

Fastening Hardware  \n\n- **Bolt type:** Use **M8 corrosion‑proof screws** together with **washers**.  \n- **Minimum washer (or screw) diameter:** **≥ 16 mm**.  \n- **Installation note:** The screws and washers are to be mounted **directly on the rail of the sub‑structure**; **no spacer is permitted between the rails** (i.e., the rails must be in direct contact with the mounting slots).  \n\n---\n\n### 5. Additional Installation Constraints  \n\n- **Rail placement relative to junction box (footnote \\*\\*):** The continuous rails **must not be positioned underneath the junction box**.  \n- **Mounting slots:** The slots referenced (Detail A, Fig. 1 in the original documentation) require the above‑specified hardware and material properties; the exact material specifications are not reproduced here but must be observed as per the original drawing.  \n\n---\n\n### 6. Summary of All Data Points  \n\n- **Configuration:** 2 continuous rails parallel to the short side.  \n- **Bolt position:** 331 mm from the module’s outer edge (center of clamp).  \n- **Test load capacity:** 5 400 Pa (push) / 2 400 Pa (pull).  \n- **Design load capacity:** 3 600 Pa (push) / 1 600 Pa (pull).  \n- **Fasteners:** M8 corrosion‑proof screws with washers of ≥ 16 mm.  \n- **Spacer rule:** No spacer allowed between the rails.  \n- **Rail‑junction‑box rule:** Rails must not be under the junction box.  \n- **Applicability:** Valid for both landscape and portrait module orientations.  \n\nAll the values, units, and conditions presented above are taken directly from the source table and accompanying notes; no additional information has been introduced.",
