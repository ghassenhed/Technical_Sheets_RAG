### 2.2 Requirements

#### **Installation Site**

Please note the following guidelines that apply to the installation site:

- Solar modules are not explosion-proof and are not suitable for use in explosive environments.
- Do not operate solar modules near highly flammable gas and vapors (e.g. gas tanks, gas stations).
- Do not install modules in enclosed space.
- Do not install modules in locations where they may be submerged in water (e.g. floodplains).
- Do not use modules as a substitute for the normal roofing (e.g. modules are not watertight).
- Do not install modules in close proximity to air conditioning systems.
- Do not install modules above 2000 m (6561 ft) altitude above sea level.
- Contact with saline water (e.g. spray water from the sea) and salt aggregation on the modules must be avoided.
- Do not bring any chemical substance (e.g. oil, solvent etc.) into contact with any part of the panel. Only substances, which are released by Qcells, are allowed to be used during installation, operation and maintenance.
- Any installation of modules on surfaces of water is prohibited. This includes installations on floating as well as pile-based platforms. Qcells may extend the coverage of its warranty to such installations, based on a case by case assessment of the system design and location. A prior written consent by the warrantor is required in any case.

The solar modules are designed for the following applications:

- Operating temperatures from −40 °C to +85 °C (−40 °F to +185 °F).
- Pull loads up to max. 2,400 Pa and push loads up to max. 5,400 Pa (see chapter "Mounting options").
- Installation using a mounting structure for solar modules.

#### **Prevention of Shadowing Effects**

Optimal solar irradiation leads to maximum energy output:

- For this reason, install the modules so that they face the sun.
- Avoid shadowing (due to objects such as buildings, chimneys or trees).
- Permanent or regular shading can lead to damage to the module. In such cases, the use of module optimizers is recommended in order to maintain the product warranty and increase the yield of the PV system.

#### **Mounting Structure Requirements**

The Modules shall be installed and operated on mounting structures that comply with any applicable laws and stipulations as well as with the following:

- Conform to the necessary structural requirements.
- Compliant with local snow and wind loads.
- Properly fastened to the ground, the roof, or the façade.
- Forces acting on the module are relayed to the mounting substructure.
- Ensures sufficient rear ventilation of the module.
- Avoid the usage of different metals to prevent contact corrosion.
- Allows for stress-free expansion and contraction due to temperature fluctuations.

- Ensure that no additional forces are applied through the mounting system into the module except for the wind and snow loads. Additional forces and moments of torque at the mounting positions caused by torsions, displacements or vibrations in the mounting system are not allowed.
- Ensure that the clamps and the mounting frame are compatible.

#### **Clamp System Recommendations**

Use customary clamps that satisfy the following requirements:

- Clamps are not in contact with the front glass.
- Clamps do not deform the frame.
- Clamps that satisfy the structural requirements based on the conditions of the installation site according to the applicable regulations and technical standards.
- Long-term stable clamps that securely affix the module to the mounting frame.
- Clamp height compliant with the frame height.

It is recommended to use Qcells Q.MOUNT clamps for mounting.

#### **Module Orientation Requirements**

- Landscape or portrait installation is permitted.
- Ensure that rain and melting snow can run off freely. No water accumulation.
- Ensure that the drainage holes in the frame are not covered. No sealing.

- Maintain the permissible angle of inclination.
  - Minimum angle of inclination: 3°
  - Inclination angles above 75° may be limited by local regulations
- Standing water on the modules glass needs to be avoided.

### 2.3 Mounting options

#### REQUIREMENTS OF ALL MOUNTING OPTIONS

- → The loads in the table are related to the mechanical stability of the solar modules. Mounting system and installation equipment (clamps, etc.) are not part of the PV module certification acc. IEC 61215/61730. The mechanical stability of the mounting system including clamps has to be evaluated by the system supplier. The listed test load values have been determined with the following clamp parameters: clamp width = 50 mm and clamp depth = 11 mm. The installer has to make sure that the used clamps and rails are capable of securely fastening the module under the specified maximum loads.
- → The system installer is responsible for the determination of location-specific load requirements.
- → Ensure, that the connection cables of the junction box do not run between laminate and mounting rails.
- → Modules bend under load. Therefore, sharp objects (e.g. screws, ballast stones, rail ends, rails with burrs or sharp corners) must not be placed near the module backside so as not to touch the laminate under load.
- → Ensure that the junction boxes do not touch the mounting structure (e.g. shorts rails, ballast, etc.) or the rooftop under load.
- → Clamps must not touch the glass (even under load).
- → Unbalanced loads (e.g. snow overhangs, snowdrifts) which result in locally significantly increased loads must be removed or avoided by technical measures.

#### Mechanical loads based on IEC 61215-2:2016.

Mounting methods in this section were tested and verified by Qcells.

Design loads result from the safety factor 1.5.

#### **Mounting options with clamps**

The illustrated installation options apply for both landscape and portrait module orientation.

### 2.4 Electrical layout

#### **Module Selection**

For detailed key electrical data, please refer to the actual data sheet referring to the relevant Module (available at www.qcells. com).

For maximum energy yields, mismatches of specified electric current (IMPP) of more than 5 % should be avoided for all modules connected in series.

#### **Safety Factor**

For detailed key electrical data, please refer to the actual data sheet referring to the relevant Module (available at www.qcells. com).

■ During normal operation, a module may generate a greater current and / or higher voltage than that determined under standardized test conditions. Please use a safety factor of 1.25 for the following:

Calculating the voltage measurement values (VOC) of components

- Calculating the current measurement values (ISC) of conductors
- Sizing of control systems connected to the outlets of the solar modules
- Please follow the valid national guidelines for the installation of electrical systems.

#### **Series Connection**

Connection of modules in series is only permitted up to the maximum system voltage as listed in the applicable data sheet of all the relevant modules to be installed.

- Take into account all possible operating situations and all relevant technical norms and regulations when designing the system. It has to be ensured that the maximum system voltage, including all necessary safety margins, is not exceeded.
- Take the voltage limit of the inverter into account when determining the maximum number of modules in the string.

#### **Parallel Connection**

Modules may be damaged by the occurrence of reverse currents (caused by module defects, ground leaks, or defective insulation).

Ensure that the maximum reverse current load capacity indicated in the data sheet is met.

In order to limit reverse currents that may occur, we recommend using the following safety options:

#### **1) Layout with a limited number of parallel connected strings :**

Without undertaking further current blocking measures, a maximum of two module strings may be operated in parallel on a single inverter or MPP tracker.

#### **2) Layout with string fuses :**

Use overcurrent devices (e.g. fuses) according to the relevant standards in each string. Use gPV-fuses according to IEC 60269- 6. Observe the maximum permitted number of strings as indicated in the specifications provided by the respective string fuse manufacturer and the technical guidelines.

#### **NOTE!**

When installing different product versions, the lowest minimum permitted reverse current load capacity applies.

#### **Inverters**

Inverters with or without transformers may be used.
